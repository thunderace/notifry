<h1>About Notifry</h1>

<p>Notify is a Android program and a server backend to deliver notifications
	to Android phones using the Google Cloud to Device Messenging (C2DM) APIs.
	This is designed to replace services that cost money, such as SMS messages,
	which would normally be used to send server notifications.</p>
