<h1>Privacy Policy and information</h1>

<p>We store only the data we need to store. Once you sign in, we have access to your email
	address and possibly a name. But no other data. We will never use your email address
	for any purpose other than letting you know of an issue with your account.</p>

<p>The service is not intended to be used to send any sensitive data to users. If you choose to use
	the service in this manner, then you accept all responsibility for that choice.</p>

<p>Messages sent via the service are stored for up to 24 hours. At this time,
	they are permanently deleted from the servers. The messages are not recoverable
	after the deletion. Notifry is not intended to be a historical record for
	notifications; it is designed with the policy that the notifications are transient
	and you should use your own systems for auditing any notifications sent.</p>

<p>We will not look at your personal data. The only exception to this is if an error occurs
	delivering your message to Google's servers, which will result in an error email being
	sent to the developer. Whilst attempts are made to not include personal data, they
	may inadvertently contain personal data, but this will not be kept any long than
	necessary, nor shared with any parties.</p>

<p>Any person knowing the source key for your source can send you notifications. Source
	keys can not be changed or regenerated. Sources can be deleted or disabled by
	users if they wish, to stop messages being sent to them.</p>

<p>When sending notifications to the server, as little information as possible is sent
	back to the sender. The sender is only sent a flag indicating success, the calculated
	size of the message, and if the message was truncated.</p>

<p>Sources that are disabled on the server level will not allow messages to be sent to them.
	The server will send an error message to the sender to let them know that the source
	has been disabled. Please be aware that this information is given to the sender, which
	may not be desirable but is a fair balance between the users and the message senders.</p>
