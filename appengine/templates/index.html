<h1>Shutdown on June 6th, 2013</h1>

<p>Notifry has been running as a free service since it was created in 2011. Unfortunately,
I don't have the time to properly maintain Notifry for the future. So I have made the difficult
decision to shut it down on June 6th, 2013.</p>

<p>There are other alternatives out there that do what Notifry does.</p>

<p>The code is open source, and available via <a href="http://code.google.com/p/notifry">the project
on Google Code</a>, although the code is starting to show it's age.</p>

<p>Thankyou for your support over the years.</p>

<h1>What is Notifry?</h1>

<p>Notifry is a push notification service to send server notifications to Android
Mobile phones, running Android 2.2 or later. It uses Google's Android Cloud to Device
Messaging APIs.</p>

<p>It is intended to replace notifications sent by SMS. SMS cost money to send,
and for single user applications (like personal Nagios servers) this can give you
real time notifications for free.</p>

<p>Unlike other systems that do the server monitoring for you, Notifry is just
intended to get the message to the phone - and no more. Notifry is meant to be
very simple and just focus on getting the notifications to the phone. You can
plug Notifry into your existing monitoring system to get the notifications
going. Users supply the system administrators with a single unique key that
identifies at message source, which they can enable or disable at will.</p>

<h2>How much and where do I get it?</h2>

<p>Notifry is free, and <a href="http://code.google.com/p/notifry">all the code is available</a> under the Apache 2 License.</p>

<p>Search for Notifry in the Android market to install. You might also like to read
