<h2>Delete device</h2>

<p>You're about to delete the device ${device.deviceNickname|h}</span>.</p>

<p>Some things you should know:</p>

<ul>
	<li>The device will be asked to deregister itself. If you want to use it again, you'll need to make sure you register it again.</li>
	<li>There is a small chance that the device won't know it's been deregistered. Please keep this in mind.</li>
	<li>This will stop any notifications being sent to the device.</li>
	<li>If the device doesn't physically exist or have the software installed, this will only remove the device from your list.</li>
	<li><b>This operation can not be undone.</b></li>
</ul>
